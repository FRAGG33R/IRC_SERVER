üö® An IRC server is a computer that runs software that implements the IRC protocol and allows users to connect to it and communicate with each other. An IRC server typically listens for incoming connections on a specific port (usually 6667) and allows users to connect to it using an IRC client.

# How does IRC server work ?

1. The IRC server listens for incoming connections on a specific port (usually 6667).
2. When a user connects to the IRC server using an IRC client, the server authenticates the user and assigns them a unique nickname.
3. The user can then join one or more chat rooms (also known as channels) on the server, or send private messages to other users.
4. When a user sends a message, the server receives the message and broadcasts it to all other users in the same chat room or private conversation.
5. The server maintains a list of users and channels and keeps track of who is in which chat room or private conversation. It also stores messages and other data related to the chat sessions.
6. The server may also implement additional features, such as user lists, topic management, and moderation tools.

# What is IRC client ?

<aside>
üö® A client is anything connecting to a server that is not another server.  Each client is distinguished from other clients by a unique nickname having a maximum length of nine (9) characters.
